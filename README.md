- 👋 Hi, I’m @PlanktonGirl
- 👀 I’m interested in cats, scifi, music, and creative stuff in general
- 🌱 I’m currently doing an unaccredited, online version of a Computer Science 101-105 sequence to get the fundamentals. The courses mainly use Python 3 and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. I'm new and need to learn a bit more first.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
